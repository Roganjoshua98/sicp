; Counting Change
; How many different ways can we make change of $1.00, given half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels,
; and pennies? More generally, can we write a procedure to compute the number of ways to change any
; given amount of money?

; The number of ways to change amount a using n kinds of coins equals:
; - The number of ways to change amount a using all but the first kind of coin, plus
; - The number of ways to change amount a âˆ’ d using all n kinds of coins,
;   where d is the denomination of the first kind of coin.

; If a is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.
; If a is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.
; If n is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.
