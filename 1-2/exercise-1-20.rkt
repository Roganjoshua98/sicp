; Exercise 1.20:
; Thee process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules used by the interpreter.
; As an example, consider the iterative gcd procedure given above. Suppose we were to interpret this
; procedure using normal-order evaluation, as discussed in Section 1.1.5.
; (The normal-order-evaluation rule for if is described in Exercise 1.5.)
; Using the substitution method (for normal order), illus- trate the process generated in evaluating
; (gcd 206 40) and indicate the remainder operations that are actually per- formed.
; How many remainder operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of (gcd 206 40)?
; In the applicative-order evaluation?
